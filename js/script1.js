/**
 * A js library for building user interfaces
		○ Written and maintained by fb
		○ Consider the best option for writing the front-end user interfaces
* Allows us to easily organize our user interface into individual components that we can then use where ever the UI needs them
    - think of it like creating our own html elements w/ custom functionality 
    - then using those elements else where
* the components can be just about anything but they tend to be organized by visual logic segments
    - i.e: specific widgets we'd see on any site
* another valuable feature is:
    - the virtual dom used w/ js or jquery to access and manipulate the dom
* IMPORTANT TO NOTE:
    - WHEN WE MESS W/ THE DOM DIRECTLY, WE DO IT AT THE COST OF THE APPLICATION EFFICENCY
